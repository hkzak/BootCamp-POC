# BootCamp-POC
Fly Nas Web App
 
 The codes here are not purely mine, its a collection of different free source code and templates and with my own addition to the codes. 
 
 The main HTML page is the " Index.html" 
 
 There is not profile page or user profile page due to time constraints. 
 
 this code is free to edit play with or share. 
 
 Find the "BootcampPoc-Screenshot" png to see the files arrangement to avoid changing files paths in the html pages. All pics should be saved in the images file and all the .css should saved in a css file and all .js should be saved in a js file.
